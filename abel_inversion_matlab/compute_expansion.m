function [ fn,hn ] = compute_expansion( X,upf,R )
% COMPUTE_EXPANSION calculates the Fourier series expansion terms, on which
% the Abel inversion algorithm [1] is based.
%
% Details: The unknown distribution f(r) is expanded as
%           f(r) = sum_{n=lof}^{upf} (A_n * f_n(r))                    (1)
% where the lower frequency is set to 1 and the upper frequency upf is
% important for noise-filtering. f_n(r) is a set of cos-functions:
%           f_n(r) = 1 - (-1)^n*cos(n*pi*r/R)  and f_0(r) = 1          (2)
% For the Abel inversion, the integrals h_n have to be calculated
%           h_n(x) = int_x^R f_n(r) * r / sqrt(r^2-x^2) dr             (3)
